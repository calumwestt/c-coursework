This hash table module gives you the ability to insert data into a hash table aswell as delete it. To improve the module I could add the ability to search through the hash table and produce an output in the console telling the user whether the data they were looking for was in the table or not. I could also add the feature to print all the data in the hash table but that may become problematic if the table were large. All function descriptions are in the file header and declarations of structs are in there also.
