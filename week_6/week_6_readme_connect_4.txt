Connect 4 - Calum West
I created this program going along the theme with a board game for the week. It is similar to the Noughts and Crosses program in some ways, however a new function had to be introduced for working out which row a coin would be dropped into based on where there were already coins in the grid.
It was also much harder to sort out a 'win' function as there are hundreds of ways in which a player can win. I used loops and split the function into the different ways in which you can win e.g Horizontally, Vertically, Diagonally (down + right) and Diagonally (down + left).
To run the program you just use ./connect_4 as there is currently no GUI feature for users to play the game, however by running ./connect_4 you can test all of the logic side of the program.
Through this personal task I have improved my knowledge of structs and what to test for as with my previous personal task I left out any testing of the program.
I made sure to try and test for lots of different scenarios and am happy with the results.
